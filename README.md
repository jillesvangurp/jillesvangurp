# Jilles van Gurp

I'm a Berlin based developer from the Netherlands. Like many developers, I try to put out a bit of code on Github. A few of my projects are getting some traction. 

Check my website for more details: [www.jillesvangurp.com](https://www.jillesvangurp.com) and for more information about engaging me as a consultant.

I'm **@jillesvangurp** in lots of places on the web; one of the benefits of having a globally unique first name + last name.
